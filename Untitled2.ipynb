        "1. Difference between interpreted and compiled languages\n",
        ">>Interpreted languages execute code line by line at runtime without producing a separate executable, while compiled languages translate the entire source code into machine code before execution, resulting in faster runtime performance.\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        ">>Exception handling is a mechanism that allows a program to handle runtime errors gracefully using try, except, else, and finally blocks instead of crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Purpose of the finally block\n",
        ">>The finally block contains code that always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurs, and is commonly used for cleanup tasks like closing files.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        ">>Logging is the process of recording messages about a program’s execution to help with debugging, monitoring, and error tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Significance of the __del__ method\n",
        ">>The __del__ method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed, mainly used for resource cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Difference between import and from ... import\n",
        ">>import module imports the entire module and requires using the module name to access its members, whereas from module import name imports specific objects directly into the namespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Handling multiple exceptions in Python\n",
        ">>Multiple exceptions can be handled by using multiple except blocks or a tuple of exception types in a single except.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Purpose of the with statement in file handling\n",
        ">>The with statement ensures that files are automatically closed after use, even if an exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n",
        ">>Multithreading uses multiple threads within the same process and shares memory, while multiprocessing uses multiple processes with separate memory spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Advantages of using logging\n",
        ">>Logging helps in debugging, tracking errors, monitoring system behavior, and maintaining application performance without interrupting program flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        ">>Memory management in Python involves allocation and deallocation of memory using automatic mechanisms such as reference counting and garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Basic steps in exception handling\n",
        ">>The steps include placing risky code in try, handling errors in except, executing optional code in else, and cleaning up in finally.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why memory management is important\n",
        ">>Efficient memory management prevents memory leaks, improves performance, and ensures optimal use of system resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Role of try and except\n",
        ">>The try block contains code that may raise an exception, and the except block catches and handles the exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How Python’s garbage collection works\n",
        ">>Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to identify and free unused objects automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Purpose of the else block in exception handling\n",
        ">>The else block executes only when no exception occurs in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Common logging levels in Python\n",
        ">>The common levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. Difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing\n",
        ">>os.fork() creates a child process by duplicating the parent process (Unix-based systems only), while the multiprocessing module provides a portable and safer way to create processes across platforms.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Importance of closing a file\n",
        ">>Closing a file frees system resources, ensures data is written properly, and prevents data corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Difference between file.read() and file.readline()\n",
        ">>file.read() reads the entire file at once, while file.readline() reads one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. Purpose of the logging module\n",
        ">>The logging module provides a flexible framework for generating log messages with different severity levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. Purpose of the os module in file handling\n",
        ">>The os module is used to interact with the operating system, including file creation, deletion, renaming, and directory management.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. Challenges in Python memory management\n",
        ">>Challenges include memory fragmentation, reference cycles, and managing large objects efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. Raising an exception manually\n",
        ">>An exception can be raised using the raise keyword, optionally with a custom error message.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Importance of multithreading\n",
        ">>Multithreading improves responsiveness and performance in I/O-bound applications by allowing tasks to run concurrently.\n",
